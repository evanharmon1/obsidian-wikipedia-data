# Obsidian Wikipedia Data Plugin

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md) that queries the Wikipedia API to add data like an image url, description, extract, and article url to your notes. It automatically queries based on your current note's title and inserts text based on a template that you can customize.

- Adds a command "Get Wikipedia Data for Active Note Title" which queries Wikipedia and inserts data based on the templates defined in settings.
